# AudioBook

This is a python project which converts any readable text into audio output.

In this project i've used pyPDF2 and pyttsx2 libraries

"PyPDF2" is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files.

"pyttsx3" is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python.


Installing the pyPDF2 and pyttsx3 modules using the commands "pip install pyPDF2" and "pip install pyttsx3" in your terminal is required to run this. I've included two sample PDFs that you may swap out for the one you prefer. In the fourth line of code, indicate the name of the PDF and the .pdf extension if you alter it (for example, book = open('Your_pdf_name.pdf', 'rb')).
